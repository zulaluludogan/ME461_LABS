Increasing the pwm frequency has two main effects:

1- If the motor is already spinning, then the motor slows down
as the pwm frequency is increased. This is because a motor is just an inductor,
and an inductor's current doesnt cannot changes instantly. Since the pwm frequeny 
is higher the inductor sees a nonzero voltage for a shorter period of time which
means that it cannot build up its magnetic field enough to rotate the motor 
at the same speed.

2- If the motor is at rest, then a higher pwm frequency is required to start the
motor for the afromentioned reasons.
